# Homebrew/versions (deprecated)

These formulae provided multiple versions of existing packages or newer versions of packages that were too incompatible to go in homebrew/core.

This tap was deprecated because homebrew/core has started to support multiple versions. All widely used, buildable formulae will be migrated to [homebrew/core](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core).

Learn more about this migration in the [Versions documentation](http://docs.brew.sh/Versions.html).
